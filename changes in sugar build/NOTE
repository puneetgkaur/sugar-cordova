paste the cordova directory in build/out/install/lib/python2.7/site-packages/jarabe/


so that the file inside the cordova folder can be imported by :

from jarabe.cordova import device as cordova_device
from jarabe.cordova import accelerometer as cordova_accelerometer
from jarabe.cordova import camera as cordova_camera
